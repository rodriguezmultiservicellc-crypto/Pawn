/**
 * Hand-written type aliases for the Pawn schema. These mirror the enums
 * defined in patches/0001-foundation.sql and any subsequent migrations.
 *
 * Why hand-written? `db:types` regenerates src/types/database.ts from the
 * live schema, but the auto-generated file overwrites whole-file. These
 * aliases are imported via `export * from './database-aliases'` at the
 * bottom of database.ts so they survive every regen.
 *
 * RULE: when you add an enum or string-CHECK column to a migration, add it
 * here too. Pre-push hook gates type-cast drift; missing aliases will show
 * up as `as any` casts that the watcher will block.
